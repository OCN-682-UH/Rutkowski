## Introduction
This is my first *Quarto* document and I am going to plot some penguin data! 

```{r}
#| message: false 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)


```
## Look at the data 
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```
## Make a plot
This is look at the relationship between **bill length** and **bill depth**.
```{r}
#| warning: false 
penguins %>% # penguin dataset 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()

```
